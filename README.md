# School Manager System

## Overview
This Java project implements a simple school management system with multiple classes representing employees, faculty, and department chairs. The program demonstrates object-oriented principles such as inheritance and method overriding.

  - Overrides `Work()` method to include office hour details.
- **DepartmentChair Class** (inherits from `Faculty`)
  - Adds department attribute.
  - Overrides `Work()` method to include department information.
- **School_Manager Class**
  - Creates instances of `SchoolEmployee`, `Faculty`, and `DepartmentChair`.
  - Demonstrates setting attributes and calling `Work()` method.
